# EnticEdge-Beyondbooksmart Development

# **Description:**

Based on the sitemap and the initial design concept provided by Entice Edge, we can provide you with a rough estimate for the project. However, please keep in mind that the estimate may change once all the requirements are finalized. From the sitemap and current live site https://www.beyondbooksmart.com/, it looks like the website will have a main 10 pages, including the homepage. The initial design concept gives us a good idea of the overall look and feel of the website.

# **Additional Comments:**

The above estimate was an initial estimate. The estimate will be revised based on additional requirements, including the creation of new pages/sections and changes in current functionality such as in donation.
